## Ideal Client Scenario

**Example: Sarah - Accounting Firm Owner**

"Sarah is the owner of a 15-person accounting firm generating $2M annually. Her website was built in 2018 and looks dated. She gets some leads from Google but knows the site is underperforming—competitors have modern sites that look more professional. Sarah has $20K budgeted for a website redesign and wants a partner who understands professional services, can handle the strategy and execution, and will be responsive when she needs updates. She's willing to invest in ongoing SEO and maintenance if it generates more high-value clients. Timeline isn't urgent but wants it done right within 8-10 weeks."

**Typical Project Range:** $5K-$15K
- Entry point: $5K-$10K (smaller projects, redesigns)
- Premium: $30K-$75K+ (complex sites, e-commerce, multi-location)
- Ongoing: $500-$2,000/month (hosting, maintenance, SEO)

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks typical (clear, transparent expectation)

**Buying Process:**
- Research phase: 2-4 weeks (looking at portfolios, reviews, awards)
- Evaluation: Wants free consultation first (calendar booking CTA)
- Decision: 4-8 weeks from first contact to contract
- Decision factors: Portfolio quality > Price, responsiveness, testimonials
