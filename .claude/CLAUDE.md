## Content Strategy

**Blog Voice: The Knowledgeable Guide Who Tells It Straight**

Think: Industry expert publishing because they have insights worth sharing, not because they need clients. Generous with knowledge, occasionally opinionated, writes like explaining to a smart friend—not a boardroom presentation.

**Key Writing Principles:**

1. **Lead with insight, not fluff**
   - Hook with real problem or contrarian take
   - Avoid: "In today's digital world..."
   - Use: "Most companies pick a design agency based on the portfolio. That's usually the wrong decision."

2. **Conversational but substantive**
   - Use contractions naturally (we're, you'll, it's)
   - Short, scannable paragraphs
   - Show your thinking, not just conclusions

3. **Use narrative and specific examples**
   - Avoid abstract concepts
   - Real scenarios readers recognize
   - "Picture this..." instead of theoretical

4. **Be slightly opinionated**
   - Push back on industry assumptions
   - Contrarian takes with evidence
   - Stand out from generic agency blogs

5. **Be specific and actionable**
   - Tell exactly what to do
   - Avoid "research the agency thoroughly"
   - Use: "Go pull up their last three projects..."

6. **End with takeaway, not sales pitch**
   - Generous summary that respects reader's time
   - Avoid: "Ready to talk? Let's chat."
   - Use: "The bottom line: it's not about price or portfolios..."

**Bucket Brigades** (use 3-4 per 500 words max):
- Contrarian: "But here's what actually matters...", "Here's where people get it wrong..."
- Examples: "Picture this for a second...", "Here's what this looks like in practice..."
- Actionable: "So here's what you actually do...", "Here's the question you ask instead..."
- Transitions: "Now here's the thing about...", "But let's talk about..."
