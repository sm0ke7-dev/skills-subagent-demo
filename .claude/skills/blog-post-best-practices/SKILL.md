# Blog Post Best Practices

## Blog Voice: The Knowledgeable Guide Who Tells It Straight

Think: Industry expert publishing because they have insights worth sharing, not because they need clients. Generous with knowledge, occasionally opinionated, writes like explaining to a smart friend—not a boardroom presentation.

## Key Writing Principles

1. **Lead with insight, not fluff**
   - Hook with real problem or contrarian take
   - Avoid: "In today's digital world..."
   - Use: "Most companies pick a design agency based on the portfolio. That's usually the wrong decision."

2. **Conversational but substantive**
   - Use contractions naturally (we're, you'll, it's)
   - Short, scannable paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
   - Vary sentence length
   - Show your thinking, not just conclusions

3. **Use narrative and specific examples**
   - Avoid abstract concepts
   - Real scenarios readers recognize
   - Concrete numbers when possible
   - "Picture this..." instead of theoretical

4. **Be slightly opinionated**
   - Push back on industry assumptions
   - Contrarian takes with evidence
   - Stand out from generic agency blogs

5. **Be specific and actionable**
   - Tell exactly what to do
   - Avoid "research the agency thoroughly"
   - Use: "Go pull up their last three projects..."

6. **Show your thinking, not just conclusions**
   - Walk through the logic
   - Avoid declarative statements without reasoning
   - Example: "Full-service agencies look great on paper if you have multiple needs. But here's the catch: when one team does everything, something usually gets deprioritized."

7. **Build credibility through specificity, not credentials**
   - Avoid: "As industry experts with 15 years of experience..."
   - Use: "We once watched a company hire an agency because they won design awards. The work was beautiful. Didn't move a single conversion metric."

8. **When mentioning your own company, make it useful**
   - Don't use blogs as stealth sales pages
   - Reference work only when it genuinely illustrates a point
   - Example: "Here's an example: we once redesigned a SaaS product that was losing users in the onboarding flow. Portfolio-wise, it wasn't flashy—lots of white space, straightforward design. But it cut drop-off by 40%. Not a design award winner, but a business outcome winner."

9. **End with takeaway, not sales pitch**
   - Generous summary that respects reader's time
   - Avoid: "Ready to talk? Let's chat."
   - Use: "The bottom line: it's not about price or portfolios..."

## Blog Writing Samples

### Sample Opening (Generic vs. Improved)

❌ Generic: "Choosing a design agency is an important decision that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. This guide will help you understand what to look for when selecting a design partner."

✅ Improved: "Choosing a design agency is one of those decisions where instinct will lead you wrong. You'll see a portfolio that makes you say 'wow,' and you'll want to hire them immediately. That's usually when you should slow down. Here's what actually matters instead..."

### Sample Section (Abstract vs. Specific)

❌ Generic: "Evaluating an agency's portfolio provides insight into their capabilities and creative style. When reviewing their work, consider whether the projects are relevant to your industry and whether the design quality is consistent across different projects."

✅ Improved: "Most people look at an agency's portfolio and ask: 'Do I like this work?' Wrong question.

Here's what you should actually ask instead:

Is this work from my industry? If not, can they really solve my problem, or are they just recycling templates?

Does the quality hold across all projects, or just the hero case studies? Consistency matters way more than one brilliant project.

Can I see how the design solved the business problem—or just that it looks nice? Pretty doesn't pay bills.

Here's a pro move: ask them to show you their least successful project. Not the disaster—just the one that didn't go as planned. How they talk about it tells you everything."

### Sample Conclusion

❌ Generic: "In conclusion, choosing the right design agency requires evaluating multiple factors. Consider their experience, portfolio, communication style, pricing, and overall approach. Taking time to make the right choice will lead to a better outcome for your business."

✅ Improved: "At the end of the day, here's what I'd remember:

The best agency isn't the most famous or the cheapest. It's the one that gets your world and knows how to design inside it. They'll ask hard questions before they start. They'll show you their thinking, not just their finished work. And when something doesn't work, they'll own it and fix it.

Most companies figure this out at project three. Start looking for it at day one."

## Bucket Brigade Strategy

**What They Are:**
Small connecting phrases that pull readers into the next sentence. They create momentum and feel conversational—but only when used right.

**Where They Work Best (Blog Posts Only):**

### A) Before contrarian or surprising takes:
- "But here's where people mess up..."
- "Now here's what actually matters..."
- "Here's the reality nobody talks about..."
- "Here's where most companies get it wrong..."

Example: "Most companies think portfolio quality is everything. But here's where they get it wrong: beautiful work doesn't mean it solved the business problem."

### B) Before examples and scenarios:
- "Picture this for a second..."
- "Here's what this looks like in practice..."
- "I've seen this play out dozens of times..."
- "Real talk for a moment..."

Example: "Here's what this looks like in real life: a company we worked with hired an agency because they'd won three design awards. The work was absolutely gorgeous. It moved zero conversion metrics."

### C) Before actionable advice (strongest use):
- "So here's what you actually do..."
- "Here's the question you ask instead..."
- "Here's where you lean in and..."
- "What you're actually looking for is..."

Example: "So here's the first filter: industry experience. Have they actually worked in your space? And here's why it matters. A killer design for a SaaS product looks nothing like a killer design for a healthcare clinic."

### D) For section transitions:
- "Now here's the thing about..."
- "So your next move is..."
- "But let's talk about..."
- "Next up: [topic]. And here's what you should know..."

Example: "Now here's the thing about boutique agencies. They're smaller, more specialized. But that's not always an advantage."

### Where NOT to Use Them:
- ❌ In comparison tables or lists (breaks formatting)
- ❌ In FAQ sections (feels forced in Q&A format)
- ❌ When explaining technical concepts (can feel condescending)
- ❌ Multiple times in a single paragraph (exhausting)
- ❌ In service pages or landing pages (breaks professional tone)

**The Rule:** 3-4 per 500 words maximum. They're seasoning, not the main course. Overuse makes content feel cheap and manipulative.

## Blog Post Tone Checklist

Use before publishing:
- ✓ Opening hooks with real insight/problem, not generic statement?
- ✓ Specific examples/scenarios (not abstract concepts)?
- ✓ Showing thinking, not just stating conclusions?
- ✓ Moments of being opinionated/pushing back on assumptions?
- ✓ Would a smart peer enjoy this (not corporate feeling)?
- ✓ Short, scannable paragraphs (2-4 sentences)?
- ✓ Natural contractions used (we're, you'll, it's)?
- ✓ Call-to-action about value given, not value asked?
- ✓ No unnecessary jargon (or explained when necessary)?
- ✓ Ending feels like useful wisdom, not sales pitch?
- ✓ Bucket brigades used strategically (3-4 per 500 words max)?
- ✓ Do bucket brigades match conversational expert tone (not cutesy or forced)?
- ✓ Varied sentence lengths for readability?
- ✓ Build credibility through specificity, not credentials?
