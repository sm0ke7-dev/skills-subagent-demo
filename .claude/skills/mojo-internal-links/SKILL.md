## Internal Linking Best Practices

**Link Density:**
- 3-5 internal links per 1,000 words (for blog posts)
- 2-4 internal links per 500-800 words (for service pages)
- Don't over-link (dilutes link value)

**Anchor Text Strategy:**
- Use descriptive, keyword-relevant anchor text
- Vary anchor text (don't use same phrase repeatedly)
- Make it natural in context (not forced)
- Avoid generic "click here" or "learn more" when possible

**Contextual Relevance:**
- Link to pages that genuinely add value for the reader
- Link early in content when possible (higher engagement)
- Prioritize service pages and portfolio for conversions
- Link to FAQ page for objection handling

**Priority Linking (High-Value Pages):**
1. Service pages (conversion-focused)
2. Portfolio pages (social proof, trust building)
3. Homepage (brand awareness)
4. About page (trust, credibility)
5. FAQ page (objection handling)

**When to Link:**
- First mention of a topic (if relevant page exists)
- Within context of explaining a service or capability
- When providing proof or examples (portfolio links)
- When addressing questions (FAQ link)
- In conclusion for next steps (service page or contact)
