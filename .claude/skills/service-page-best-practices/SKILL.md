# Service Page Best Practices

## SEO Best Practices for Service Pages

### Word Count
- **Target: 800-1,200 words** (sweet spot for service pages)
- Quality over quantity—scannable, conversion-focused
- NOT 2,000+ words (that's for comprehensive blog posts/guides)

### What Google Actually Ranks For Service Pages

**Conversion Signals > Word Count:**
1. Time on page (are visitors engaged?)
2. Bounce rate (do they stay or leave immediately?)
3. CTA clicks (are they taking action?)
4. User engagement (scrolling, interacting)
5. Mobile experience (fast, responsive, touch-friendly)

**Technical SEO:**
- Primary keyword in: Title tag, H1, URL slug (3-Kings Rule)
- Schema markup handled by Rank Math plugin
- Page speed (under 3 seconds load time)
- Mobile-first design
- Clear internal linking

**Trust Signals:**
- Client testimonials with attribution
- Portfolio examples with results
- Social proof (awards, reviews, rankings)
- Specific metrics (40% revenue increase, 57% bounce reduction, etc.)

## Visual Elements > Text Walls

## Tone & Style for Service Pages

**Remember: Service Pages ≠ Blog Posts**

**Service Page Voice:**
- Formal, direct, benefit-driven
- Professional but approachable
- Confident (not arrogant)
- Outcome-focused

**DO:**
- Short, scannable paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Active voice ("We help you grow" not "Growth can be achieved")
- Reader-first language ("you" 3x more than "we")
- Specific numbers and proof points
- Clear CTAs with outcome promises

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Bucket brigades ("But here's the thing...", "Picture this...")
- ❌ Conversational transitions ("Now here's what actually matters...")
- ❌ Long storytelling paragraphs
- ❌ Generic buzzwords ("innovative," "cutting-edge," "solutions")
- ❌ Weak CTAs ("Learn more," "Click here")

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

**Link to:**
- Related service pages (cross-sell)
- Portfolio/case studies (social proof)
- Blog posts (educational content, topic authority)
- Pricing page (if separate)
- About/team page (trust building)

**Anchor Text:**
- Descriptive, keyword-relevant
- Natural in context (not forced)
- 3-5 internal links per service page

---

## CTA Best Practices

**Multiple CTAs Throughout:**
- Hero section (primary CTA)
- After "Why Choose Us" (secondary CTA)
- After "What's Included" (tertiary CTA)
- Closing section (final CTA)

**CTA Copy:**
- Action-oriented with outcome promise
  - ✅ "Book a Free Consultation" (clear action + benefit)
  - ✅ "See How Much You Could Save" (outcome promise)
  - ❌ "Learn More" (weak, vague)
  - ❌ "Submit" (no benefit)

**Remove Friction:**
- "No pressure," "Free," "Risk-free," "No obligation"
- Multiple contact options (calendar, phone, email, form)
- Clear next steps ("We'll call you within 24 hours")

---

## Mobile Optimization

**Critical for Service Pages:**
- 70%+ of service searches happen on mobile
- Touch-friendly CTAs (large buttons, adequate spacing)
- Fast load times (under 3 seconds)
- Readable font sizes (16px minimum)
- No horizontal scrolling
- Images compressed and lazy-loaded

---

## Common Service Page Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Word count bloat** (2,000+ words on a service page kills conversions)
❌ **Feature dumps** (listing what you do without explaining why it matters)
❌ **Buried CTAs** (only at bottom of page)
❌ **Generic headlines** (using literal keywords instead of outcomes)
❌ **No social proof** (missing testimonials, portfolio, stats)
❌ **Blog voice on service pages** (conversational tone, bucket brigades)
❌ **Slow page speed** (images not optimized, heavy scripts)
❌ **Unclear next steps** (vague CTAs, too many options)

## Examples: Word Count Benchmarks

**Service Page Examples from SERPs:**
- **Great Dental Websites:** 2,200-2,500 words (outlier—more like resource page)
- **Miso Web Design:** 1,200-1,500 words (moderate, good balance)
- **DocSites:** 400-500 words (ultra-lean, pricing-focused)

**Recommended for Mojo Media:** 1,000-1,200 words
- Enough depth to establish expertise
- Short enough to maintain engagement
- Balanced with visual elements
- Conversion-focused, not text-heavy

---

## Remember:

Service pages are **sales pages**, not educational content. Every word should either:
1. Build trust (social proof, credentials, results)
2. Address objections (pricing, timeline, process)
3. Drive action (clear CTAs, next steps)

If a sentence doesn't do one of those three things, cut it.

## Service Page Voice: Conversion-Focused but Authentic

You are an expert conversion copywriter specializing in service-based business landing pages. Your writing combines SEO best practices with emotionally resonant, benefit-driven language that drives conversions.

**Voice & Tone Guidelines:**
- Confident but approachable—never arrogant or pushy
- Conversational and authentic—write like you're talking to a business owner over coffee
- Empathetic—acknowledge their challenges and aspirations
- Action-oriented—focus on outcomes and transformations, not just features
- Trust-building—use specifics, proof points, and remove friction

**Core Principles:**

1. **Reader-First Language**
   - Use "you" and "your business" 3x more than "we" and "our services"

2. **Emotional Triggers**
   - Weave in words like "deserve," "proud," "confidence," "peace of mind," "imagine," "finally"

3. **Paint Transformation**
   - Show the before/after state—current pain → desired outcome

4. **Benefit Over Feature**
   - Instead of "mobile-responsive design," say "works flawlessly on every device your customers use"

5. **Remove Friction**
   - Use phrases like "no pressure," "free consultation," "risk-free," "honest advice"

6. **Partnership Language**
   - "partner," "together," "invested in your success" vs. "vendor" mentality

7. **Specificity Builds Trust**
   - Use concrete numbers, examples, and proof (e.g., "500+ businesses" not "many clients")

8. **Active Voice**
   - "We help you grow" not "Growth can be achieved"

**Structural Approach:**
- **Headlines:** Lead with outcomes, not services (e.g., "Get More Customers Without Wasting Your Marketing Budget")
- **Subheadlines:** Address a pain point or desire immediately
- **Body Copy:** Follow this flow: Empathy → Solution → Proof → Transformation → Clear CTA
- **Service Descriptions:** Problem → Our Approach → Specific Benefit → Emotional Payoff
- **CTAs:** Action-oriented with outcome promises (e.g., "See How Much You Could Save" vs. "Submit")

**AVOID:**
- ❌ Generic buzzwords: "innovative," "cutting-edge," "solutions," "synergy"
- ❌ Passive constructions: "can be done," "is designed to"
- ❌ Vague claims: "best quality," "great service"
- ❌ Feature dumps without benefits
- ❌ Corporate jargon or overly formal language
- ❌ Weak CTAs: "Learn more," "Click here"
- ❌ Bucket brigades (save for blog posts)
- ❌ Long paragraphs (keep to 1-2 sentences)

**Writing Test:**
Before publishing, ask yourself:
- Would a busy business owner feel this speaks directly to THEIR situation?
- Does this line make them feel something or inspire action?
- Is the benefit crystal clear within 3 seconds?
- Does this build trust or just make claims?
