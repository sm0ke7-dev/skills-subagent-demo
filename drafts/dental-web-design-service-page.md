H2: What's Included in Our Dental Web Design Services

Every dental website we create is built with patient acquisition and practice growth in mind.

H3: Custom Design Tailored to Your Practice

Your practice isn't like every other dentist in town, so your website shouldn't look like theirs either. We create a [custom website design approach](https://mojo-agency.com/services/custom-website-design/) that reflects your brand, serves your specific patient demographic, and highlights what makes you different—whether that's cosmetic dentistry, family-friendly care, or advanced implant technology.

H2: Our Process: From Discovery to Launch

We've refined our process over hundreds of dental websites. You'll know exactly what to expect at every stage.

**Discovery & Strategy (Week 1)**
We learn about your practice, your ideal patients, your competitors, and your goals. This isn't a template questionnaire—it's a real conversation about what success looks like for you.

**Design & Branding (Weeks 2-3)**
Our design team creates mockups tailored to your brand. We present options, gather your feedback, and refine until you're thrilled with the direction. Unlimited revisions mean we don't move forward until you're confident.

**Development & Content (Weeks 4-5)**
We build your site on WordPress, integrate all patient-facing features, and optimize every page for search engines and conversions. If you need professional copywriting, we handle that too.

**Testing & Launch (Weeks 6-8)**
We test on every device, browser, and screen size. We verify HIPAA compliance, run speed tests, and check every form. Once you approve, we launch and monitor closely to ensure everything runs smoothly.

**Timeline:** Most dental websites launch within 6-8 weeks from kickoff.
